		<para>The rb_register service goes from VERIFYING to CLAIMED and stores the certificate that will authorize the communications with redborder Live.</para>
		<para>In redborder Live the user can see a green circle in the Last Checked column of the Sensors section: this means that the sensor has been properly registered.
		This column also indicates the time lapsed since the last sensor check.</para>
